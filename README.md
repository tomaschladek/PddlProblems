# PddlProblems
Several PDDL problems
- Sliding tile 4x4
- Sokoban – warehouseman has to put crates on defined positions. Crates can be moved by pushing
- Rush-Hour – moving cars in the matrix. Car can be moved vertically or horizontally if there is space in that direction. The goal is to moved specific set of positions (leave the matrix through gate)
- Rubic cube
